After collecting and merging the raw data into one data frame, I was able to identify that the study group of 249 mice for the skin tumor clinical study were subjected to different drug treatment regimens to observe the effect on tumor volume. Among these regimens, Ramicane and Capomulin stood out with the lowest mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error statistics, indicating their effectiveness in reducing tumor volume.

Treatment Regimens and Outcome: Ramicane and Capomulin demonstrated significant success, both showing a mean tumor volume of around 40mm3.

Gender Distribution: The study's mice were evenly distributed among sexes, with 49% females and 51% males.

Correlation between Mouse Weight and Tumor Volume for Capomulin: Using data visiulaization the scatter plot and linear regression analysis demonstrated a strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.84) between mouse weight and tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin. This suggests healthy body weight may play a crucial role in preventing tumor growth.

Conclusion: Overall, Capomulin was found to be effective in reducing tumor volume. The study shows evidence that Ramicane and Capomulin are promising drug treatment options for skin tumors in mice. Additionally, the correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume emphasizes the importance of a healthy body weight as a preventative measure against skin tumors in mice.
